# FixMinimapSquadron
This fixes the incorrect position of squadron icons on the minimap.
It's been 3 or maybe 4 months since it's broken. WG, please.

# Install
1. Download the zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui` folder.
3. Move `gui` folder to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/gui/unbound2/mods/minimap_squadron_fix.unbound`
4. Done!
